rawblock
========

Rawblock JS is a simple UI component library, that allows to create re-usable, accessible, responsive and self-contained components using either ES5 or ES6.

As a dependency for rawblock either 'rawblock/$.js' or jQuery has to be included. In most cases 'rawblock/$.js', which provides a jQuery like API and adds itself to the `rb.$` namespace should be good enough.

For older browsers some polyfills (IE11-), namely DOM4 and some ES6 Promise/String/Array/Object polyfills (_polyfills.js) has to be added.


Basic Component Markup
---------

In general the component markup consists of a `"js-rb-live"` class and `data-module` attribute with the name of the component as its value.

```html
<div class="js-rb-live" data-module="my-component"></div>
```

Getting started: Writing new components
---------

A good starting point is to read the API documentation for the [`rb.live.register` method]{@link rb.live.register} and the [`rb.Component` class]{@link rb.Component}.

A simple backbone to start playing around would look like this:

```html
<div class="js-rb-live" data-module="my-component"></div>
```

```js
import {Component} from 'rawblock';

Component.register('my-component', class MyComponent extends Component {
    constructor(element, initialDefaults){
        super(element, initialDefaults);

        this.log(this.element);
    }
});
```

Getting started: Customizing/Extending existing components.
---------

All components are classes and added to the `rb.components` namespace with their name. The button component for example can be found at [`rb.components.button`]{@link rb.components.button}.
